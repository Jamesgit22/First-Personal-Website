            <h4>Learning track</h4>
            <p>So far, I have been utilizing freecode camp to learn the basics of html and css. It has been incredibly helpful and fun to use. I am still trying to understand how to use flex and grid to better format a page. I recently learned about media quiries so I am currently working on adding some responsiveness to this webpage. I also created my GitHub account and will be commiting this personal website to it.</p>
            <p>Also I have not learned how to use forms yet so this contact section below is just for practice and does not currently work.</p>
